                    I remember when I was still a teenager and I had too much love for IT, and here I get a chance of
                    working
                    with my Uncle in his shop where he dealt with computer accessories and I utilised all the time I had
                    there
                    to learn more in this field. And from that time I just increased the love I had for it, here I am
                    writing my
                    code and performing magic, I wont tell you that it has been an easy road, but just know those that
                    persist
                    win, work hard,be willing to learn and network with different kinds of people, have role models in
                    that
                    field where you
                    want to achieve, and yes you will achieve come to pass.<br>
