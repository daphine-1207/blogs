                        <p class="card-text">Well, my first day before getting into my first class, I was curious and oh
                            yes, I felt it was right to be curious but I was also expectant at the same time. Truth be
                            told
                            I was a bit scared to because cohort 1 told us that Catalyst aint easy at all and I was just
                            saying God help me I have the best day in class and understand whatever is going to be
                            taught
                        </p>

                        <p class="card-text">Truth is it was an amazing experience for me the fact that we got to learn
                            about our facilitator and how he talked to us made me feel comfortable and relaxed. So, tell
                            you
                            what I just set my head to class and only thought about what was being said/taught, putting
                            the
                            fear aside and I should say I understood what he taught but the curiosity and expectation
                            didn’t
                            move, the more he taught the more I became more curious and expectant. And I should say yes,
                            my
                            expectations have been fulfilled. Am getting out of this class knowing all that I felt like
                            I
                            should know in my introductory part of software engineering.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">With HTML and CSS, it wasn’t a new experience because we had our
                            facilitation
                            about it before with Mark and Steven and I explored it that I even built my first website
                            using
                            the two. Though I wasn’t taught bootstrap and When I got to learn about it in Samson’s
                            lessons,
                            I just fell deep in love with the whole thing, it has made things easy for me and coming up
                            with
                            a website is not going to be hard anymore, coding with all the three is made easy for me.
                            Truth,
                            is I came with love for coding but truth is it wasn’t too much but it has increased and I
                            can’t
                            explain it anymore. I am in love with what am coding because of this class we have had with
                            you
                            Samson.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">My best lessons in this introduction to software engineering are those
                            where we
                            have studied about the version control system (git), git in the cloud and bootstrap, getting
                            to
                            know that things are getting easier the more I am open to learning. These have been amazing
                            lessons, because I learnt how to deal with these step by step, to me they were the ones that
                            seemed to be hard for me and I have finally mastered them and thanks to the facilitators we
                            have
                            (Samson mostly then Mark and Steven). You have made sure that we understand every bit of
                            these
                            topics and oh yes, I say you deserve to be appreciated.</p>

                                feel
                                I am
                                in the right place and am going to make it. These lessons have encouraged to carry on
                                regardless
                                of the circumstances, they have taught to make more research for me to be an up-to-date
                                software
                                engineer. They have prepared me for the next classes, I feel motivated, zealous, and
