                <h5 class="card-title">it was an infirmative class I should say</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Well, this has been very educative, I won’t say that have not a lesson or lecture
                    like this in my life but this has been different. I feel that have improved in the areas that have
                    been badly off, the self-checks just hit differently and in a positive way that they just get me
                    into a position of understanding myself better, my weaknesses and strengths. I believe have improved
                    and started applying what have learnt in my life.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Being proactive</h5>
                <p class="card-text">I learnt that being proactive makes me feel better and it creates space for
                    effective thinking. It allows me see positivity, this spoke to me and I am working on being more
                    proactive than reactive because being reactive limits me from thinking creatively.</p>

                    and purpose in life and this is going to make a difference in my life.</p>

                <p class="card-text">I learnt that am supposed to I should spend my time on what’s important, focus on
                    my highest priorities, eliminate the un important, plan my every week and stay true in the moment of
                    choice.
                    And I considered planning every week as one that is going to help me develop personally and in this,
                    I learnt that I plan my week by connecting with my mission, roles and goals, scheduling the big
                    rocks and lastly scheduling my activities around the big rocks.

                    other people’s wins as well as your own and creating win-win agreements. With courage I am supposed
                    to share my ideas and opinions with confidence, with consideration I am supposed to acknowledge
                    other people’s ideas and opinions, these stood out for me.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Here I learnt that I have greater influence with others if I truly understand them
                    first and understanding precedes action and judgement. What worked out for me was empathic
                    listening, that my intention as am listening must be I listen to understand and reflect feelings and
                    words, with this am supposed to ask clarifying questions.</p>

                    planned/set goal. So, we are meant to come up with something that’s better than what either of us
                    have in mind. I have to value differences and seek the third alternatives.</p>

                <p class="card-text">This is the most important habit because it covers all the other six, it’s the one
                    that helps us deal with the rest because it deals with me my body, heart, mind and spirit, it shows
                    me that its me to invest in myself before investing in others. I must care for my body, spirit, mind
                    and heart.

                <p class="card-text">Well, my feeling in this class, I felt like have discovered me more, how I should
                    run myself in order to be effective and efficient in all spheres of my life. From the level of
                    dependency (attitude of you) to independency (attitude of I) to interdependency (attitude of we).
                    Am just too grateful that am equipped I should say and these classes have been very helpful.
                    Thank you Julia and Michael your impacting lives.
